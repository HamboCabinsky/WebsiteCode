          <p>In preparation for Unit 1, please read Chapter 1 of Lord of the Flies.</p>
          <p>We have a new console command, openLOTF(pg), where pg is the page number to turn to.</p>
          <p>The javascript console can be used from here or visual console page, check the page if you need instructions.</p>
          <p>If openLOTF is not working, you may need to go to your enable pop-ups for this website in your browser settings</p>
          <p>According to the <a href='https://www.humanesociety.org/animals/pigs'>Humane Society</a> pigs are smarter than dogs and 3 year old children.</p>
          <p>One might notice that Piggy's intelligence is not appreciated by the other boys. It takes him a lot of effort to have his concerns considered and they're valid concerns given the gravity of the situation.</p>
          <p><a href='https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/pigs-know-their-fate-when-they-enter-a-slaughterhouse-expert-says-1.3829977'>Pigs are intelligent enough to recognize their mortality. </a>When pigs are slaughtered in the slaughterhouse, they are aware they are about to be killed and show fear. </p>
          <p>In Chapter 1, Piggy seems a lot more worried than the other boys about the situation they are facing. Is this because Piggy is more intelligent and thus more aware of his mortality?</p>

          <p>In the original <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em>, the movie follows a family of murderers who have become desensitized to bloodshed as a result of their working at a slaughterhouse.</p>
          <p>The 2022 <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> remake features a hero of the story who valiantly slaughters a pig on screen to introduce her to the story.</p>
          <p>Is this a respectful thing to do considering the message of the original film?</p>

            "You have empty eyes". Eyeless may be a reference to Indian beggar children, whose eyes were burned out by adults so the sight of them would elicit more pity. What other meanings can you find?</p>
