          <p>My name is Frank Howard and I am so excited to teach your child's 4th grade class! Your little guy or girl will know me as Mr. Frank, but you can call me Frankie. I've been working in the education industry for many years and know just what it takes to mould a young child's mind to its maximum potential. I believe a good education is rooted in connection with divine works and works generated by divine inspiration. This is because God can operate best with a direct avenue to the Chosen.<p>
          <p>This year, we will start by looking in the Bible, at the book of Genesis, up until the divide between Abraham, Sarah, and Isaac, Hagar and Ishmael and how it developed into the divided nations of Israel and Islam. We will talk about the similarities and differences between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. We will also touch on the large role Jesus plays in Islam as well versus his role in the second coming in Christianity.<p>
          <p>Among Biblically-inspired works we'll look at, we will dive into Lord of the Flies by William Golding and The Hellbound Heart by Clive Barker.<p>
          <p>Every year, employers are requiring our entry-level professionals in a variety of fields to become increasingly more tech-literate. To prepare our young minds for this, I have set up a number of exercises utilizing the browser Javascript console. This teaches them basic programming concepts in an environment they are likely to use them even if not pursuing a career in computer science. This is because web-development skills are extremely useful in all sciences, as well as outside the sciences.<p>
          <p>First, students will learn to use the console to call certain pre-defined functions. As students build familiarity with the console and basic programming concepts, we will use the visual console playground to demonstrate some phenomena in a variety of fields of math and science.<p>
          <p>The primary domains we will be looking at are 
          * Religion
          * English/Literature
          * Science/Tech
          * Music<p>
          <p>For our music domain, there will be required listening spanning the great variety of rock music that the United States has enjoyed over about the past eighty years. Students will be tested on their knowledge of lyrics to help them identify meaningful messages in popular music. The visual console can also be used to visualize music theory concepts for various instruments. Students who want to learn instruments will be given the opportunity to learn how to identify a key a popular song is in and how to identify which notes are in that key on their instrument so they can play along. <p>
